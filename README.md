# Implementing-Cracking_RSA
Use python to implement RSA encryption algorithm then use different methods to crack it.

## Two Ways of cracking
### 1. Mathematical Attack
Attack is done by trying to know the the two prime factors of n, 
so we can get Phi_n, and then get d (private key) to decrypt the message.

### 2. Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)
